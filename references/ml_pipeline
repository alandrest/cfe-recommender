Django -> ML Pipeline
    - Get Data - by Django orchestration tools (Fake)
        - [x] User
        - [] Ratings -> Colaborative Filtering algorithm (ML)
        - [] Dataset -> Movies
            - Scrape from the internet (for example imdb)
            - API service -> Software-to-Software
            - User generated content -> cold start problem
            - Open Source Datasets -> Kaggle -> The Movies Dataset
    - Prepare Data - Django & pandas
    - Train Model from Data
            -> to orchestrate: Django & Celery
                -> ml algs: Keras /PyTorch
    - Use Model on New Data

Cold Start Problem: (if no data - how to start?) - prepare faked data at the beginning
